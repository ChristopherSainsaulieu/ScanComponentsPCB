This application permit to test if missing components on the SmoothieBoard electronic card.","body":"###   Welcome to ScanComponentsPCB Pages.\r\n\r\n## What is ScanComponentsPCB ?\r\n\r\nScanComponentsPCB is a software available on Linux 32-bit/64-bit or Windows  32-bit/64-bit (it is also available on MacOS and Android: see below) programmed with Processing in Java, which can detect possible missing components on a electronic card. The project consists of a software part and hardware part. \r\n\r\nsoftware part contains a database in which there is all the coordinates of 307 components of the SmoothieBoard card in millimeter. The mechanical/hardware part includes SolidWorks plans for the construction of the test-bed, which can be made with wood and magnets for adjusting the webcam.\r\n\r\na exemple of test-bed prototype:\r\n\r\n![test-bed prototype](http://s23.postimg.org/lrvnh21ej/Test_bed1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://s16.postimg.org/h2z48gbtx/Test_bed2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://s29.postimg.org/cg188npvb/test_bed3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're wish using the ScanComponentsPCB for Mac, simply export the ScanComponentsPCB.pde file which Processing for Mac. If you're wish using the ScanComponentsPCB for Android, please refer to this Web page:\r\nhttp://wiki.processing.org/w/Android.\r\n\r\n\r\n### SmoothieBoard\r\n\r\nSmoothieBoard is an Open Source Hardware CNC controller board based on the LPC 1769 or LPC1768 Cortex-M3 chip.\r\nIt is intended to run the Smoothie modular firmware ( GPL too ), and is targeted at 3D Printers, Laser cutters, CNC Mills, Pick and place and other small-sized CNC machines. Larger machines can be driven using the bare version and external drivers.
